[x] Add score board					
[x] Add logic for ball going out of bounds
		- Ball gets placed in front of person who scored until they press space and start again
[x]	- Score gets incremented

- Tell the player whether they're left or right
	- Text at first
	- Color later

[x] Logic for what happens after winning
[x]	- Let them just hit refresh for now

- Server re-write - state machine
[x]- Trying to avoid this
[x] Client refactor - manage state more effectively (again)

- Networking code - synchronise state periodically
