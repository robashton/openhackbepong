- Add score board
- Add logic for ball going out of bounds
		- Ball gets placed in front of person who scored until they press space and start again
		- Score gets incremented

- Tell the player whether they're left or right
	- Text at first
	- Color later

- Logic for what happens after winning
	- Another game? (Both say yes, paddles get switched)
	- One closes window? Same logic as usual

- Server re-write - state machine
- Client refactor - manage state more effectively (again)

- Networking code - synchronise state periodically
